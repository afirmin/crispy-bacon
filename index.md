## Welcome to Ant's Blog


Yes, ANOTHER tech blog but I also plan on launching a youtube channel too which will work hand in hand with this blog.

### A bit of repository code

If you want to download my coding schizzle then use this to download it...
(you may want to download and install 'git' first!)

```markdown
mkdir ants-code
cd ants-code
git init
git clone git@github.com:afirmin/demo-repo.git
```

### The Plan

I will be totally honest, I am not sure what the plan is at the moment, well, I do have a plan but it is on a pile of post it notes and I really need a Trello board for it all!

### The Timescales

One of those post-it notes sugegsts one video a week - achievable? We shall see!
